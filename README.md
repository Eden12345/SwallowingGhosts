# Swallowing Ghosts

Swallowing Ghosts is a digital interactive book that allows the user to explore a story on their terms. It is built with React Native and the styling is optimized for iOS. The chapters are still being written and edited, so what you'll see using Expo is currently only a demonstration of the format of the app.
