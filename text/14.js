const string = `Originally, I’d majored in biological research science. Not long before graduation I was drafted into a satellite repair and defense unit. I’d be a RAD. This was the war effort at work. Somewhere purpose was being manufactured. As a research scientist the change took effort, but the physical demands were somewhat welcome. The laboratory days of youth were replaced with calisthenics, and songs of discipline. I had nothing concrete towards which to rebel. Everything terrible had already been decided, and begun. So I conformed to my new responsibilities.\n

Training required a level of awareness that was foreign to my wandering mind. Dreadful thoughts, and happy ones that sat at the forefront of everything were replaced by the basics: left hand forward, right hand check belt, neck still, eyes up, legs in position, heart rate stable, and so on.\n

If you are careless, death. If you hesitate, death. Position yourself, at all times, so that you are facing whatever is coming your direction. This may seem counter intuitive, but turning your back to debris only increases the chances that something the size of an arrowhead hits your rear at the right angle and shuts down your suit’s central computer, or worse, breaches your exterior reserve of oxygen. Then death. The boot camp instructor/soon to be captain was neither menacing nor loving, only honest.\n

I don’t recall them ever providing us with a word of encouragement or insult, just facts and statistics. This many died last month, now here’s every reason why, and how this could of been prevented. We sat in a series of dark classrooms, watching the raw video feed from the suits of the fallen. Meticulously analyzing every incorrect movement that lead them from duty to death. I remember one where two units of debris, each the size of my twin mattress, collided, probably only 50 meters from the RAD. Rather then analyzing the likely trajectory, or turning their back to make an ill planned, and unlikely to work, escape - they remained in their position.\n\n`
